Apache http is Modular

System of plugins that add specific functionality 
Apache comes with a set of default modules that are included upon 
compiliation 
Static modules included upon compilation are compiled to httpd and are loaded everytme apache is started the time apache is started.
Shared modules added without compilation
Dynamically loaded  meaning they can be turned on and off 
Slower than static modules but are more flexible 


 
Modules Have Directives 
> Configure additional functionality 
> If config has module directives and module is missing 
  Server wont start due to a syntax error
> To prevent that situation the module is wrapped in configuration in  
  ifModule . 
  Example: <ifModule mod_ssl> 

  Example: $apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES

Changing httpd Configuration
----------------------------
Depends on distribution and method of installation
Describe how to do it in ubuntu
High level , steps will be similar
 - Some commands will be different
 - Might not be available

Know which distribution you're using
 - Consult documentation for best practices

Debian Module Configuration
 /etc/apache2/mods-available ->Contain every module with known configuartion

 /etc/apache2/mods-enabled  ->Contain symbolic link to mods-available

Two debain commands that helps in modules 
 >a2enmod
 >a2dismod

 They both enable/disable Apache Modules by creating and removing symbolic links from the enabled to the available directory.


 Example 

 $cd /etc/apache2/mods-available ls -la
 .conf - contain configuration  directives  
 .load - loads the module 

 Example: Mods Available

 $cat /etc/apache2/mods-available/status.conf
 File status.conf starts with <ifModule mod_status>

 $cat /etc/apache2/mods-available/status.load
 Load module loads a dynamic module 


 Example: Mods Enabled 

 $cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/status.conf

 Blue color indicate they are symbolic links they shortcuts to the actual
 file 

 $sudo a2dismod status
 $ls -la /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
 $sudo service apache2 graceful
 $apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES
 $apachectl status
